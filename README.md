## Installation

TODO add cocoapods and carthage here

## Usage

You can use any of the preset coachmarks using OSListCoachmarkGenerator or create any custom view in the same fashion. Here is how you would embed your custom view inside the coachmark. 

```swift
let view = CustomCoachmarkView()
let coachmarkView = OSCoachmarkView()
coachmarkView.attachedView = view
```

Sizing of the above custom coachmark will be based on autolayout subject to min/max constraints.
To position the coachmark relative to the view, you can write your own logic to show/hide the coachmark or you can use OSCoachmarkPresenter to do this. Here's an example of what this might look like - 

```swift
let coachmarkPresenter = OSCoachmarkPresenter()
coachmarkPresenter.view = coachmarkView
coachmarkPresenter.attachToView(self.view, anchor: .bottom)
```

OSCoachmarkPresenter objects can attach a coachmark to a given view with two modes - top and bottom. All animation and presentation logic is taken care of with you only having to call show() and hide() based on any logic you choose.

```swift
// Show
self.coachmarkPresenter.show()

//Hide
self.coachmarkPresenter.hide()
```


Checkout the example Xcode Project in the Example folder which has a demo with all three classes in action üöÄ
